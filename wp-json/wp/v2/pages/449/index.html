Demographic trends, along with the significant effects of the pandemic, have substantially impacted enrollment levels across the CSU including CSUN (projected drop of 9.5 % in FTES in 2022-23). <em>&#8220;Strengthening Equitable Culturally Responsive Environments\u201d (SECURE) for Student Success <strong>(S)fS<sup>2<\/sup><\/strong>\u201d: Using a Servingness Model to Support Hispanic and Underrepresented Students\u201d<\/em> is designed in collaboration with two community colleges (LA Pierce College, and College of the Canyons), to expand the number of Hispanic and underrepresented (URM) students in Art, Health Sciences, Engineering, Computer Science and the STEM disciplines and reduce equity gaps in achievement. It supports CSUN\u2019s efforts to enhance recruitment, stem the decline in enrollment, and improve fiscal stability. Closely aligned with CSUN\u2019s <em>Road Ahead<\/em> (long-term strategic plan), <em><strong>(S)fS<sup>2<\/sup><\/strong><\/em> is a cross-divisional, multi-disciplinary project, to address and institutionalize the competitive preference priorities in the DHSI RFP through four major objectives: <strong>1.<\/strong> Increase enrollment, improve academic performance (retention\/graduation rates) and reduce equity gaps. <em>(CPP 2(a), 2(b), 2(c), 2(d))<\/em>, <strong>2.<\/strong> Expand and enhance curriculum, research internships, and culturally-relevant, work-based learning experiences in in-demand industry sectors. <em>(CPP 1(b), 2 (d))<\/em>, <strong>3.<\/strong> Support and increase faculty capacity to plan and implement culturally responsive pedagogies, proactive advisement and mentoring. <em>(CPP 1(c))<\/em>, and <strong>4.<\/strong> Develop a \u201cServingness\u201d model and culturally enhancing academic experiences to support mental health, emotional wellbeing, and academic outcomes. <em>(CPP 1(a), IP)<\/em><\/p><p>Strategies and activities to accomplish these objectives include targeted outreach and recruitment, summer bridge workshops, ongoing workshops on study skills, time management and financial literacy, research internships, faculty, peer and industry mentoring programs, career guidance, increased experiential learning opportunities, wrap-around student services to support students in hybrid\/virtual learning environments, and webinars on mental health and emotional wellbeing. Curriculum will be expanded and enhanced to emphasize culturally responsive pedagogies to reduce equity gaps, close articulation gaps, and develop and offer hybrid\/online courses that improve access for working students. Bi-annual workshops and faculty professional development activities are built on Garcia, Nu\u00f1ez, and Sansone\u2019s (2019) <sup>1<\/sup>servingness model at HSIs to support 40-50 faculty to create a culturally responsive faculty community of practice. Select anticipated<br \/>outcomes (in support of Hispanic and low-income undergraduate students) to be accomplished in 5 years:<\/p><p><strong>1.1<\/strong> Increase enrollment by 10 %, from 18,313 (fall 2022) to 20,144.<br \/><strong>1.2<\/strong> Increase the number of Hispanic. and low-income undergraduate students retained and who complete a degree program by 10 % and 20 % respectively compared to the year 1 baseline.<br \/><strong>2.1<\/strong> Increase the number of students participating in experiential learning opportunities by 500 in 5 years.<br \/><strong>2.2<\/strong> Increase the number of hybrid\/virtual undergraduate courses by 10 per year over the year 1 baseline.<br \/><strong>3.1<\/strong> Increase by 50, the number of faculty professional development opportunities to enhance and use CRT, and increase the number of participating faculty by 100 in 5 years over the year 1 baseline.<br \/><strong>3.2<\/strong> Increase by 100 the number of revised courses and modules using CRT, and serve 6,000 students in 5 years.<br \/><strong>4.1\/4.2<\/strong> Gains in reports of peer-mentoring, cultural validation, and campus belonging will increase by 5 % annually.<\/p><p>The project\u2019s participatory evaluation framework examines the relationship between student participation in the transfer model and (a) validation and belongingness, (b) social-emotional learning and development, (c) academic success and program completion, and (d) career preparation in their chosen fields. The study will use a mixed-methods design. Multiple data sources, including student group interviews, student structured journals, group survey (Undergraduate Research Student Self-Assessment), faculty group interviews, institutional data, and matching analysis with both institutional and program data (quasi-experimental design or QED) to examine institutional changes from program activities will be used. Individual faculty or group interviews will be facilitated to support understanding of changes in equity-minded teaching. The evaluation study will use a culturally responsive approach, including an informant at the community colleges and CSUN, investigator triangulation and peer feedback, and member checks with research participants.<\/p><p>Looking to the future, employment opportunities are especially high in areas such as Digital Technology, AI, Health Sciences, Cybersecurity, Biotechnology, Advanced Manufacturing, Clean Technology, and Sustainability. Our overall goal is to increase CSUN\u2019s capacity to serve the needs of Hispanic and URM students in these fields, and to recruit, enroll, retain, and prepare them for exciting careers in the post pandemic workforce. With the launch of CSUN\u2019s Global HSI Equity Innovation Hub in fall 2024, and CSUN\u2019s <em>Road Ahead<\/em> strategic plan we are well positioned to achieve the project objectives and ensure sustained long-term outcomes after federal funding ends.<\/p><hr \/><p><sup>1<\/sup>Garcia, Nu\u00f1ez, &amp; Sansone.
